# Peer Review Comments

## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is fine except for one small issue. The slope and intercept values are hidden by the legend and are not visible in the graph. This could be fixed by adding: ```plt.legend(loc='lower right')```
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**. 
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points** as well, as I completed the task as asked and provided a clear explanation of the code.

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution looks good. To compute the correlation, the reviewee used a NumPy-based approach while I used a Pandas-based one. I believe the latter is a better choice, but it does not significantly affect the outcome. There was also a question about which features could be dropped and why. The reviewee offered a good explanation about why some features could be removed, but did not mention the specific feature names. In my case, I identified the features that could be dropped and justified this based on their correlation coefficient values.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would also rate my own work **5 points**, as I performed the task as required and provided the necessary explanation.

## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The task was completed nicely, with appropriate comments that make the approach easy to understand.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**. I completed the task with the required solution and added comments for clarity. There is a slight difference in the plots created by me and the reviewee, but both plots show the same information in slightly different ways.

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks related to data preparation, including feature engineering, were performed as instructed. The remaining work was also completed well, with good comments explaining the solution.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I successfully completed the task and followed all instructions.

## Problem - 5
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The reviewee explained the three concepts—Overfitting, RFE, and K-fold Cross-Validation—very well. Great work!
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**. also explained all three concepts clearly with examples, though I used code for some explanations, unlike the reviewee who provided some conceptual descriptions without code.
