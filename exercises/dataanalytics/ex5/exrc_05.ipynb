    "There is some unknown data in your `exrc_05/data/ah4323_unknown_data.csv`. All you know is that the first five columns are the features and the last column is the response. Use scikit-learn's LinearRegression to fit a linear model to this data. Also implement a function `unknown_data` that reads the file, \"learns\", and returns the correlation coefficient for each of the five features against the response. You don't have to fit the intercept in linear regression, and you also don't have to split the data in your \"training\". The main method should just print out the coefficient for each of the five features, and use all the data for \"training\". Do you think that some of the features could be dropped from the model? Why?\n",
