# Peer Review Comments

## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**:  Can't verify this since it can be done by Harri only.
- **Evaluation**: Not Applicable 
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I did the task as asked.

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution looks good and explained quite nicely about usage of np.random.binomial and scipy.stats.binomial.pmf functions.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.   
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would also rate my own work **5 points**, since I perfomed the task as required and explained the behaviour.

## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: Nicely explained the learning experience about Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I have shared my learning experience too.

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: As per my understanding the solution is partially acceptable, the ask was to ** Any hour that are in either of the files should be included ** for this outer join to be used but inner join used in the solution. 
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **4 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I have completed the task successfully and obtained the expected output. I also explained via graph that time of the day also affect no of bicyles during the day and not just temperature

## Problem - 5
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution looks great in terms on analysing projects and prepearing the meaningful data out of it. But I found few things were missing like there are no analysis regarding Groups and Users data, Histograms of project counts, star counts, and forks, Analysis of user activity (commits, issues, etc.), Identify the most popular projects based on stars and forks.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **3 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I have completed the task and tried to do as much as possible in terms of analysing the Projects, Groups and Users information.
