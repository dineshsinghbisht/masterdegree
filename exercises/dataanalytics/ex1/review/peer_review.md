## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution provided is acceptable, but it could be improved in terms of formatting, depth of content, and quality of examples. Additionally, the use of AI tools could have been leveraged more effectively.  
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **3 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I believe I prepared the document in a proper format, with structured presentation and quality content.  

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output. However, since I am still learning NumPy and Python, I was not able to fully understand the logic behind some part of the solution.  
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I completed all the tasks and also verified the results.  

## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output and I can understand it.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **4 points**, as I completed all the tasks and verified the results. However, I did not use the requested math function to further test my code, since I felt it was unnecessary after already observing a noticeable difference with the existing function.  

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output, program runs without any issue.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I was able to complete the task successfully and my output matches too here. In my case I kept the header too in the output.

## Problem - 5
