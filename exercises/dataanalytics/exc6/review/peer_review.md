# Peer Review Comments

## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All the tasks starting from dropping rows missing values to print Accuracy Score and Confusion matrix are done with nicely and there are nice explaination about each piece of code. Reviwee also formatted the Cofusion Matrix in the print to make it more readablle which is great. Overall nice work don here.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**. 
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points** as well, as I completed the task as asked and provided propoer comments about the each steps used in the solution.

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution looks good. Almost similar steps involved as Problem 1 to train and test the Classification Model - SVM. At end nicely exlained the conclusion of the results with Accuracy and Confusion
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would also rate my own work **5 points**, as I performed the task as required and provided the necessary explanation. In my case I have solved the problems with two different approach first without Scaling the Features and Second where feature scaling is performed before training and testing the model to get better results.

## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: Once again all the tasks mentioned in the problem peformed with some nice comments and explaination. I could see reviewee used train/test split (80/20) unlike me where I used train/test split (70/30) and due to this we have difference in Accuracy Score and Confustion matrix which is kind of expected.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**. I completed the task with the required solution and added comments for clarity.

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks related to analysing data, including feature engineering ie one hot encoding, splitting the data for train and test and then training / testing model, finally displaying the Accuracy Score and CM are done quite nicely with comments everywhere supporting the solution. Good work once again, could not have done better than this.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I successfully completed the task and followed all instructions. I could see reviewee used train/test split (80/20) unlike me where I used train/test split (70/30) and due to this we have difference in Accuracy Score and Confustion matrix which is kind of expected, its similar to **Problem 3**. 
I need to study this topic related to train / test split, guess not one size fit to all and it could vary case by case but worth to study and come up with some good finding.

- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.
