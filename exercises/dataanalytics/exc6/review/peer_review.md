# Peer Review Comments

## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks—from dropping rows with missing values to printing the Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix—were completed nicely. There is clear explanation for each piece of code, and the reviewee also formatted the Confusion Matrix output to make it more readable, which is great. Overall, good work done here.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**. 
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I completed the task as requested and provided proper comments for each step used in the solution.

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution looks good. The steps are almost similar to those in **Problem 1** for training and testing the SVM Classification Model. The explanation of the final results, including Accuracy and the Confusion Matrix, is nicely done.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would also rate my own work **5 points**, as I performed the task as required and provided the necessary explanation. In my case, I solved the problem using two different approaches—first without feature scaling and then with feature scaling—to compare and achieve better results.

## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks mentioned in the problem were completed with clear comments and explanations. I noticed the reviewee used a train/test split of 80/20, unlike my 70/30 split, which explains the differences in Accuracy Score and the Confusion Matrix. This is expected.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**. I completed the task with the required solution and added comments for clarity.

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks related to data analysis—such as feature engineering using one-hot encoding, splitting the data, training and testing the model, and displaying the Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix—were completed well, with helpful comments throughout. Great work; it couldn’t have been done better.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**,as I successfully completed the task and followed all instructions. Similar to **Problem 3**, the reviewee used an 80/20 train/test split while I used 70/30, which explains the difference in accuracy results. I realize I need to study more about choosing appropriate train/test split ratios, as this may vary depending on the case.

## Problem - 5
- **Feedback on the Solution**: All tasks mentioned in the problem were performed well, and the results look good. Comments were added to explain different parts of the solution. The probability calculation for the given test data also looks correct. Once again, because the reviewee used 80% of the data for training, the results appear better compared to mine, as I used 70%.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**. I completed all required tasks, including data preprocessing, validation, model training/testing, and final probability calculation for Loan_status = Yes.
