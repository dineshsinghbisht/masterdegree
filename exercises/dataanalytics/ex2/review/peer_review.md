# Peer Review Comments

## Problem - 1
- **Feedback on the Solution**: Code ran successfully and all results are as expected. All the tasks are explained well with the code and comments. Good Work  
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points** as well, all the outputs are as expected and explained the code with proper comments  

## Problem - 2
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected outputs for both tasks. Comments around codes are good too. I ran the code with my data and it exactly matches with my ouputs.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I completed all the tasks as asked and also verified the results.


From here to dos
## Problem - 3
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output and I can understand it.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **4 points**, as I completed all the tasks and verified the results. However, I did not use the requested math function to further test my code, since I felt it was unnecessary after already observing a noticeable difference with the existing function.  

## Problem - 4
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output, program runs without any issue.
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I was able to complete the task successfully and my output matches too here. In my case I kept the header too in the output.

## Problem - 5
- **Feedback on the Solution**: The solution is acceptable as it produces the expected output. Executed the program again and it produced the required output.  
- **Evaluation**: I would rate the solution **5 points**.  
- **Self-Evaluation**: I would rate my own work **5 points**, as I was able to complete the task successfully and obtained the expected output.
